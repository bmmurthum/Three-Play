# Three-Play

A Suite of Three Games: Sudoku, Checkers, and Othello

This project represents a mirror of the initial repository that had been developed concurrently with two other groupmates.

## Introduction

This program represents a suite of three games. It was developed in parallel with the learning of terminologies and process in the more general study of the software development process. With that, this project can be said to be designed with an Agile workflow, in that there was many continual meetups with the "client," there was an intiative to have a quick, rough, working project, then to also have many regular checkpoints to have developed at particular stages. The course was also a study of technologies in development planning and code packages for quality testing (Git, Checkstyle, Eclipse, Trello and JUnit).

As a group project, it was also an exercise in communications, admitting to some coding standard, handling other's code, and handling potential social-frustrations. For this group, it ended up being a very pleasant experience. I would highly recommend my groupmates from this project.
